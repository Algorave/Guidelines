# Algorave guidelines

**FIRST AND FOREMOST**: By all means, do go ahead and host / promote an Algorave! And have fun.

Algorave is not a protected brand or franchise, you are free to do what you like with it. However it is a community, and these are some community-sourced guidelines for taking part.

You can’t go wrong with full range speakers in a small, dark room, preferably with fog/haze (which makes projections look much better). Have seating on hand for those who might need it, but where possible people should be encouraged to dance and move. If you want to do a concert with rows of seats that’s fine but best not call it an algorave.

It doesn’t have to all be live coded, but most performances/acts should involve code-based and algorithmic generation of music and visuals, in a way that makes the code or algorithmic process visible. Feel totally free to mix things up with other artforms/approaches in the interests of fun+diversity though.

Having ‘headliners’ are generally frowned upon. Algoraves are not always ‘raves’ as such, but it’s good to be inspired by some of the spirit of semi-anonymous people playing to unified crowds.

Algorave is free culture so be careful with any sponsorship/institutional alignment. It’s totally fine for promoters to perform as residents at algoraves they’re organising, but don’t go too far with self-promotion. Use it to lift each other up.

If people are already active in your area, get in contact + get involved. If possible, come along to an algorave before thinking about organising one yourself. They’re pretty fun.

Try to have a diverse lineup. This diversity includes but is not limited to: coding / live-coding experience, gender, ethnicity, class, age, belief/non-belief, and education. A diverse lineup creates a diverse audience which leads to a diverse community, and is beneficial to all. Additionally it is also nice to see a range of different technologies and approaches to keep things moving.

It’s best to focus on diversity right from the start. Once people get the impression of e.g. a boys’ club it’s hard to shake that off.. Plus we’re fighting against heavy biases in both club and computer science culture… Look to create a new space from day one.

Algoraves should be safe spaces. Consider having a code of conduct to promote accessibility, here’s an example: https://github.com/danhett/algoraveconduct

Ask for guidance! There is an active community of performers and event organizers who are 
happy to help; they can also provide guidance and resources for using the visual identity for promotional materials. The Algorave channel on the Live Coding Slack is a good place for this: http://live-code-slack.herokuapp.com
